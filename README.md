# MAT4376

## How This Page Works

There are the following 6 sections we want to hightlight within this file: 

  * DataCleaning: This is where all of our datasets and updates to the datasets are located. Any changes we made to the dataset was logged as a new version and is located in this folder. 
  * Documentation: This is where we have documented all of our work. Items such as the data dictionary, the persona we made for Jim, 
  * **Visualizations** (see below)
  * **project-1-team-3.pdf**: A compilation of the data dictionary and the script we used when creating the video. This is a back-up for the video in case you would like to dive deeper into a certain section. 
  * **project-1-team-3** (video): A link to our final video that has been submitted. 
  * README: This is what you are currently reading. It has links to all of the important folders/pages that contain our work for this project. 
  * Tasks (see below)

## Visualizations
[Visualizations can be viewed HERE](Visualizations/README.md). This collection of images are those that were included within the video, as well as some initial visualizations we looked into at the beginning of the project. 

## Tasks

Located in the "[Issues](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376/issues)" section. Each task has an "assignee", or person who the task was completed by. Tasks with multiple assignees were completed in collaboration.
