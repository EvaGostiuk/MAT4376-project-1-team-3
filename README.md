# MAT4376: Project 1

*Team 3: Alli Selwah, Eva Gostiuk, Emily McDonald*

## How This Page Works

There are the following 7 sections we want to highlight within this file: 

  * DataCleaning: This is where all of our datasets and updates to the datasets are located. Any changes we made to the dataset was logged as a new version and is located in this folder. 
  * Documentation: This is where we have documented all of our work. The data dictionary, the persona we created for Jim, and the timelines of the Candidates' scandals are in this section.  
  * **Visualizations** (see below)
  * README.md: This is what you are currently reading. It has links to all of the important folders/pages that contain our work for this project.
  * **project-1-team-3.pdf**: A compilation of the data dictionary and the script we used when creating the video. This is a back-up for the video in case you would like to dive deeper into a certain section. 
  * **[MAT4376: project-1-team-3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOZwOtblS_E)**: Our final video without music. 
  * **[MAT4376: project-1-team-3](https://youtu.be/-7cGPy3hSF4)**: Our final video with music. 
  * Tasks (see below)

## Visualizations
[Visualizations can be viewed HERE](Visualizations/README.md). This collection of images are those that were included within the video, as well as some initial visualizations we looked into at the beginning of the project. 

## Tasks

Located in the "[Issues](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376/issues)" section. Each task has an "assignee", or person who the task was completed by. Tasks with multiple assignees were completed in collaboration. There is a filter on the top right to look at specific assignees and what they have worked on.
